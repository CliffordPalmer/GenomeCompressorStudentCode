| April 5 |   9-10pm    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               I tried to write abstract, efficient code. |

My compression method is to assign each DNA base to a number 0, 1, 2, or 3, and store those numbers as 2 bits each, effectively compressing down the size of each letter from 8 bits to 2. It's difficult to test without the expansion algorithm, but it seems like the compression is working. |
| Nov 13  | 11:00-11:30 |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Wrote the expansion algorithm, going two bits at a time and assigning them to their letter value and writing that value to the binary file. However, I'm getting an extra A at the end of my expanded sequence for some reason, and I've been scratching my head for a while. I'm not sure how to debug in the terminal... |
| Nov 13  | 11:30-12:00 | Ugh. It seems like my bug comes from the fact that the file has to be a certain number of bytes long, and the DNA sequence doesn't end up making a nice multiple of 8 in terms of bits, so it fills in the remaining space with zeros, which correspond to and A in the sequence. Now, I reserve the first 32 bits of the compressed binary file to store the length of the sequence, so that I can use a for loop when expanding instead of just expanding until the file is empty. With that fix, It works! and the compression ratio is pretty good, at around 24.7%. |
